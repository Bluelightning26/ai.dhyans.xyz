This is a web wrapper of Hack Club's open AI project made with the assistance of Claude (mainly Sonnet 3.7)

While, like the API this is not secured, please do not use if you're not a Hack Clubber as that is against the terms.

**Terms of use:** You must be a teenager in the Hack Club Slack.
All requests and responses are logged to prevent abuse.
Projects only - no personal use.
This means you can't use it in Cursor or anything similar for the moment!
Abuse means this will get shut down - we're a nonprofit funded by donations.
